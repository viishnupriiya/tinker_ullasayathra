# [ULLASAYATHRA] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Project Description
[🌸 Ullasayathra: The Serendipity Travel Engine
Ullasayathra is a web application designed for travelers who prefer spontaneity over rigid schedules. It uses a "Vibe-Check" logic to generate personalized mystery trails while connecting you with trusted friends nearby in real-time.

* Key Features
Vibe-Based Planning: An 8-step immersive questionnaire that captures your "Wallet Vibe," "Adventure Spectrum," and "Foodie Profile" to craft the perfect trip.

Social Radar: Integrated mapping that requests location permissions to show pins of trusted contacts currently in your destination.

The Ottamind Plan: A mystery itinerary mode where only Day 1 is revealed, unlocking subsequent days only upon check-in.

Retro Aesthetic: A modern Single Page Application (SPA) wrapped in a "Vintage Film" UI with grainy textures and sunset gradients.]

### The Problem statement
[The Planning Fatigue & Solo-Travel Gap
Travelers struggle with fragmented event scheduling and the "loneliness gap" of exploring alone. Despite being in the same city, friends often miss each other due to a lack of real-time awareness, turning potential shared memories into missed connections]

### The Solution
[Ullasayathra creates personalized event schedules that proactively notify you when friends are in your locality. By bridging the gap between planning and proximity, it transforms solitary trips into connected social experiences, making every journey less lonely.]
